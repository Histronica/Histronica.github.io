In the land where the sun sets red<br>
With a foe united<br>
For courage like theirs, it was nothing but gold<br>
<br>
With a battle cry they shook the earth<br>
For glory, for valor, to prove their worth <br>
A clash of empires, a war of the world <br>
The echo of heroism unfurled<br>
<br>
In the land where the sun sets red<br>
Legends of valor and courage were bred<br>
From the rolling hills to the blood-soaked plain<br>
A tale of defiance that shall remain<br>
<br>
Against the spears, against the might<br>
They fought for their land, they fought for their right<br>
Zulu warriors, brave and bold<br>
Their story of defiance shall forever be told<br>
<br>
On Rorke's Drift, they took their stand<br>
Under a siege by the Zulu band<br>
With every volley, each precise hit<br>
The soldiers fought, they'd never quit<br>
Through the fire, the blood, and the night's cold chill<br>
Their valor grew, their spirits still<br>
<br>
At dawn they rose, with hearts ablaze<br>
To face the odds, in desperate strays<br>
With the roar of guns, they built their tale<br>
For history's pages, that courage won't pale<br>
A story written in blood and sweat<br>
In battles fought, no soul forgets<br>
