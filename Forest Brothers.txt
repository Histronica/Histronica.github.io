In the forests of the Baltic, where shadows reign<br>
The echoes of defiance, we rise again<br>
From the embers of freedom, we take our stand<br>
Against the Red tide, in our homeland<br>
<br>
In the heart of the night, our voices roar<br>
For our fallen brothers, forever more<br>
With every bullet, with every tear<br>
We'll keep the flame of resistance near<br>
<br>
Forest Brothers, in the depths we roam<br>
Against the oppressors, far from home<br>
With courage burning, and will of steel<br>
We'll never yield, never kneel<br>
<br>
In the dense woods and under moonlit sky<br>
We fight for freedom, we'll never die<br>
With rifles and knives, we take the fight<br>
To the invaders, with all our might<br>
<br>
In the heart of the night, our voices roar<br>
For our fallen brothers, forever more<br>
With every bullet, with every tear<br>
We'll keep the flame of resistance near<br>
<br>
Forest Brothers, in the depths we roam<br>
Against the oppressors, far from home<br>
With courage burning, and will of steel<br>
We'll never yield, never kneel<br>
<br>
Trough the storms of history, we stand tall<br>
For our nation's honor, we give our all<br>
Though outnumbered, we never fear<br>
We'll keep fighting, year after year<br>
<br>
In the face of oppression, we stand tall<br>
For our homeland, we give our all<br>
Though the path is rough, and the fight is hard<br>
We'll guard our forests<br>
We'll stand guard<br>
