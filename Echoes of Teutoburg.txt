Shields are raised, 'neath the sky,<br>
The eagles clash with wolves tonight<br>
Over hills and through the fray, <br>
Twilight echoes with the fight<br>
Steel on steel, sparks will fly, <br>
The frenzied blare of war is nigh<br>
Laurels and the oak leaves bind, <br>
Fiercely fought for humankind<br>
To victory, our souls are sworn to fight<br>
<br>
Forge your swords, hear the cries,<br> 
A war cry in the night<br>
Legends born, on this ground, <br>
Varus faces Arminius' might<br>
Bravery’s tale, in the mist, <br>
Where Roman legions clashed with pride<br>
Honor's call, through the trees, <br>
As Germanic warriors rise<br>
<br>
Hail<br>
March with honor, our hearts are filled with steel<br>
Hail<br>
March with honor<br>
Stand your ground<br>
Stand your ground<br>
<br>
Fight for freedom, through the storm, <br>
Teutoburg's fierce battle cry<br>
Ancient woods, bear the scars, <br>
Of a history etched in time<br>
Thundering hearts, as the drums pound,<br> 
Echoing Arminius's call<br>
Untamed spirits, their courage found,<br> 
Charging 'gainst the Roman wall<br>
<br>
Hail<br>
March with Honor<br>
Hail<br>
March with growl<br>
Hail<br>
March with Honor<br>
<br>
Stand together, shield by shield,<br> 
Keep the line and do not yield<br>
Freedom cries in every heart, <br>
This is where we all take part<br>
With our might, we’ll turn the tide,<br> 
In the forest's darkest night<br>
Cries of liberty resound<br>
On sacred, ancient battleground<br>
<br>
Hail<br>
March with Honor<br>
<br>
Raise the banners, through the gloom <br>
Ancestors watch their valor bloom<br>
With each beat, the earth will shake<br> 
A tale of might at history's stake<br>
Iron grip and shield-wall tight <br>
In unity they stand to fight<br>
Echoes of the ancient wrath<br>
Carving freedom's fateful path<br>
<br>
Hail<br>
March with Honor<br>
Hail<br>
March with growl<br>
Hail<br>
March with Honor<br>
