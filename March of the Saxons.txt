Well it's an AI to generate Songs,<br>
In the heart of Germania, a land of might<br>
Where legends are forged, in the fire's light<br>
This is the forest where warriors roam<br>
<br>
Saxony, a kingdom, a warrior's home<br>
From the Elbe's embrace to the Harz's height<br>
Saxony's valor shines in the darkest night<br>
Saxony, land of bravery and pride<br>
<br>
The Saxons in their armored might, marching onward<br>
Through the fight!<br>
<br>
Sword and fire, lead the charge<br>
Sveneld's sons, hearts large<br>
In conquering shadows, they draw the light<br>
Heroes all in history's sight<br>
<br>
Saxony a Kingdom for fight<br>
<br>
Raise the banners high for the Saxon grit<br>
Stand against the storm, never will submit<br>
Forging destiny with blood and might<br>
In the clashing swords we claim our right<br>
Beneath the watchful gods, they take their stand<br>
Loyal sons of Saxony, protect the land<br>
<br>
Raise the shield wall, hear the raven's call<br>
Iron and will, we defy our fall<br>
Stand with me, brethren, beneath war's crown<br>
Unto the Odin's gaze, we will not bow down<br>
<br>
Saxony, unyielding in the fray<br>
For our ancestors' honor, we fight today<br>
<br>
In the frostbitten morn, where the ravens soar<br>
Saxons rise, with the call of Thor<br>
Through the whispers of pines and the clash of steel<br>
They march on the land that fate will seal<br>
A storm of iron, a surge of might<br>
In the breaking dawn, they surge to fight<br>
