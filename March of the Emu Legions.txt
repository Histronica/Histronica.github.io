For every farm hand, for every night<br>
In their hearts burns the valiant light<br>
<br>
Emus on the march, but the men stood brave<br>
Emus on the march, their homeland to save<br>
The clash of valor, where honor thrives<br>
Emu soldiers faced, with their steel-bright lives<br>
<br>
In the land down under, a war did commence<br>
Against the emus, a foe without sense<br>
The farmers cried out, their crops under siege<br>
From feathered invaders, a relentless siege<br>
<br>
On the march, in the fields they roam<br>
in the heart of homeland<br>
Mhhmm-ahaww-mhaww-ahawww<br>
On the march, in the fields they roam<br>
in the heart of homeland<br>
<br>
The farmers wept, the battle was lost<br>
The emus reigned, no matter the cost<br>
A humble surrender, the men laid down arms<br>
Admitting defeat to the land's wild charms<br>
<br>
Men in despair, tales they spun<br>
Of the great emu war, that couldn’t be won<br>
<br>
On the march, in the fields they roam<br>
in the heart of homeland<br>
Mhhmm-ahaww-mhaww-ahawww<br>
On the march, in the fields they roam<br>
in the heart of homeland<br>
<br>
Hear the cry from the wind, the emus stand tall<br>
Steel clashed with beak, the bravest of all<br>
Thundering drums, and the guitar’s fierce solo<br>
Shouting the anthem, where the brave dare follow<br>
Lands of the south, with spirits they soar<br>
Heroes and legends, forevermore<br>
<br>
The tale goes on, the echo resounds<br>
In the battle where pride and feather found<br>
Emus on the charge, through the dust and heat<br>
Emus on the charge, they never face defeat<br>
The flash of the steel, the roar of the guns<br>
Yet the emus ran on, they wouldn't be undone<br>
